        For the past year, life has been a complete new journey for me. I just
        graduated from one the greatest Coding Bootcamps ever, which showed me
        my real passion and what is going to be the only type of work I will be
        doing until last days and Iâ€™m sure, I will be doing some insane work for
        the years to come.
